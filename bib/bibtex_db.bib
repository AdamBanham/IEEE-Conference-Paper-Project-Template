  title    = {Robust drift characterization from event streams of business processes},
  year     = {2018},
  abstract = {Process workers may vary the normal execution of a business process to adjust to changes in their operational environment, e.g. changes in workload, season or regulations. Changes may be simple, such as skipping an individual activity, or complex, such as replacing an entire procedure with another. Over time, these changes may negatively affect process performance; hence it is important to identify and understand them early on. As such, a number of techniques have been developed to detect process drifts, i.e. statistically significant changes in process behavior, from process event logs (offline) or event streams (online). However, detecting a drift without characterizing it, i.e. without providing explanations on its nature, is not enough to help analysts understand and rectify root causes for process performance issues. Existing approaches for drift characterization are limited to simple changes that affect individual activities. This paper contributes an efficient, accurate and noise-tolerant method for characterizing complex drifts affecting entire process fragments. The method, which works both offline and online, relies on two cornerstone techniques: one to automatically discover process trees from event streams (logs), the other to transform process trees using a minimum number of change operations. The operations identified are then translated into natural language statements to explain the change behind a drift. The method has been extensively evaluated on artificial and real-life datasets, and against a state-of-the-art baseline method.},

  title    = {Multi-Level Process Mining: Balancing Behavioural Quality and Model Complexity},
  year     = {2020},
  abstract = {A process discovery technique automatically creates a process
model based on behaviour recorded in an event log. A well-known
challenge for any process discovery technique is to strike the right balance
between the behavioural quality of a discovered model compared
to the event log and the model's complexity as perceived by stakeholders.
Event logs typically contain multiple event data attributes, however
existing process discovery techniques cannot use this information, resulting
in either highly complex and incomprehensible models or simple yet
imprecise models. Dierent types of behaviour and reasoning may also
require dierent modelling concepts and thus, arguably, there is no single
right modelling language to represent a business process, or even parts of
a business process. This paper addresses the problem of striking a better
balance using hierarchical information readily available in event logs. We
introduce multi-level process models, which support multiple modelling
formalisms and data attributes in a single model, and we present process
discovery and conformance techniques for these models. The resulting
Multi-Level Miner (MLM) framework has been implemented as a plugin
of the open-source process mining framework (ProM) and has been
evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using multiple real-life event
logs.},

  abstract  = {Many organisations now seek to analyse and improve their processes using event logs from various IT systems supporting their operations. Process mining aims to obtain insights from such process data, using process discovery, conformance checking and performance measures. While many commercial process mining tools feature user-friendly directly follows-based process maps, they typically do not offer a way to assess the quality of the model, leaving users with potentially unreliable insights, which could lead to the wrong conclusion being drawn from these insights. In contrast, academic tools typically provide verifiable results, but are often difficult to use and understand for stakeholders, sometimes overgeneralising behaviour to fit more extensive process model formalisms. In this paper, we bridge this well-known gap between commercial and academic tools by combining sound process discovery, conformance checking and performance capabilities with user-friendly directly follows-based process models. We implemented these techniques in a new process mining tool and applied them to analyse several business processes in a Queensland Government department. We discovered sound directly follows-based process models from their logs, compared them with prescribed models and analysed the performance of these processes. In particular, our conformance checking techniques allowed to pinpoint deviations between prescribed processes and actual recorded behaviour. The outcomes of this case study are now being used to document, review, improve and automate processes.},

  title       = {Unsupervised Event Abstraction using Pattern Abstraction and Local Process Models},
  abstract    = {Process mining analyzes business processes based on events stored in event logs. However, some recorded events may correspond to activities on a very low level of abstraction. When events are recorded on a too low level of granularity, process discovery methods tend to generate overgeneralizing process models. Grouping low-level events to higher level activities, i.e., event abstraction, can be used to discover better process models. Existing event abstraction methods are mainly based on common sub-sequences and clustering techniques. In this paper, we propose to first discover local process models and then use those models to lift the event log to a higher level of abstraction. Our conjecture is that process models discovered on the obtained high-level event log return process models of higher quality: their fitness and precision scores are more balanced. We show this with preliminary results on several real-life event logs.},

Yet, low-level events recorded by information systems may not directly match high-level activities that make sense to process stakeholders. This results in discovered process models that cannot be easily understood. To prevent such situations from happening, low-level events need to be translated into high-level activities that are rec- ognizable by stakeholders. This paper proposes the Guided Process Discovery method (GPD). Low-level events are grouped based on behavioral activity patterns, which capture domain knowledge on the rela- tion between high-level activities and low-level events. Events in the resulting abstracted event log corre- spond to instantiations of high-level activities. We validate process models discovered on the abstracted event log by checking conformance between the low-level event log and an expanded model in which the high-level activities are replaced by activity patterns. The method was tested using two real-life event logs. We show that the process models discovered with the GPD method are more comprehensible and can be used to answer process questions, whereas process models discovered using standard process discovery techniques do not provide the insights needed.},

However, such mapping of events to activities is a considerable challenge. The current status-quo is that approaches indicate only likelihoods of mappings, since there is often more than one possible solution. To increase the quality of event to activity mappings this paper derives a contextualization for event-activity mappings and argues for a stronger consideration of contextual factors. Based on a literature review, the paper provides a framework for classifying context factors for event-activity mappings. We aim to apply this framework to improve the accuracy of event-activity mappings and, thereby, process mining results in scenarios with low-level events.},

process mining on the control-flow perspective (cf. the chapter of Automatic Process
Discovery). As an example, the recent advances have led to discovery algorithms that
can discover models such as that in Figure 1. This model only shows the control-flow,
namely the ordering with which activities can be executed in the process.
Event logs are typically of such a form as in Figure 2. Automatic process discovery
techniques only focus on the first two columns of an event log, the case identifier (e.g.,
the customer id) and the activity name, thus overlooking a lot of insightful information
pertaining other perspectives, such as the organization perspective, the decision
perspective (a.k.a. the data or case perspective) and the time perspective [24].
The control-flow perspective is certainly of high importance as it can be considered
as the process backbone; however, many other perspectives should also be considered
to ensure that the model is sufficiently accurate. This chapter will focus the attention
on the decision perspective and will not discuss the organization and time perspectives.
Readers are referred to [24] as initial pointer to explore the research results regarding
the latter two perspectives.},

  abstract = {An automated process discovery technique generates a process model from an event log recording the execution of a business process. For it to be useful, the generated process model should be as simple as possible, while accurately capturing the behavior recorded in and implied by the event log. Most existing automated process discovery techniques generate flat process models. When confronted to large and complex event logs, these approaches lead to overly complex or inaccurate process models. An alternative is to apply a divide-and-conquer approach by decomposing the process into stages and discovering one model per stage. It turns out however that existing divideand-conquer process discovery approaches often produce less accurate models than flat discovery techniques when applied to real-life event logs. This article investigates the hypothesis that the weaknesses of existing divide-andconquer approaches lies in the way stages are identified. The article contributes a technique to identify stages from an event log based on a modularity measure as well as a technique for discovering process models based on a given stage decomposition. An experimental evaluation shows that the proposed stage identification technique finds stages that are closer to those identified by human experts, while the proposed stage-based process discovery technique outperforms existing flat and divide-and-conquer discovery techniques with respect to well-accepted measures of accuracy and model complexity.},

business processes. The vast majority of contemporary discovery
algorithms aims at the identification of control-flow constructs.
The increase in data richness, however, enables discovery that
incorporates the context of process execution beyond the controlflow
perspective. A “control-flow first” approach, where context
data serves for refinement and annotation, is limited and fails to
detect fundamental changes in the control-flow that depend on
context data. In this work, we thus propose a novel approach for
combining the control-flow and data perspectives under a single
roof by extending inductive process discovery. Our approach
provides criteria under which context data, handled through
unsupervised learning, take priority over control-flow in guiding
process discovery. The resulting model is a process tree, in which
some operators carry data semantics instead of control-flow
semantics. We evaluate the approach using synthetic and realworld
datasets and show that the resulting models are superior
to state-of-the-art discovery methods in terms of measures that
are based on multi-perspective alignments.},

  abstract   = {Process mining offers a variety of techniques for analyzing process execution event logs. Although process discovery algorithms construct end-to-end process models, they often have difficulties dealing with the complexity of real-life event logs. Discovered models may contain either complex or over-generalized fragments, the interpretation of which is difficult, and can result in misleading insights. Detecting and visualizing behavioral patterns instead of creating model structures can reduce complexity and give more accurate insights into recorded behaviors. Unsupervised detection techniques, based on statistical properties of the log only, generate a multitude of patterns and lack domain context. Supervised pattern detection requires a domain expert to specify patterns manually and lacks the event log context. In this paper, we reconcile supervised and unsupervised pattern detection. We visualize the log and help users extract patterns of interest from the log or obtain patterns through unsupervised learning automatically. Pattern matches are visualized in the context of the event log (also showing concurrency and additional contextual information). Earlier patterns can be extended or modified based on the insights. This enables an interactive and iterative approach to identify complex and concrete behavioral patterns in event logs. We implemented our approach in the ProM framework and evaluated the tool using both the BPI Challenge 2012 log of a loan application process and an insurance claims log from a major Australian insurance company.},

  abstract  = {Local Process Models (LPMs) describe structured fragments of process behavior occurring in the context of less structured business processes. In contrast to traditional support-based LPM discovery, which aims to generate a collection of process models that describe highly frequent behavior, High-Utility Local Process Model (HU-LPM) discovery aims to generate a collection of process models that provide useful business insights by specifying a utility function. Mining LPMs is a computationally expensive task, because of the large search space of LPMs. In supportbased LPM mining, the search space is constrained by making use of the property that support is anti-monotonic. We show that in general, we cannot assume a provided utility function to be anti-monotonic, therefore, the search space of HU-LPMs cannot be reduced without loss. We propose four heuristic methods to speed up the mining of HU-LPMs while still being able to discover useful HU-LPMs. We demonstrate their applicability on three real-life data sets.},

  year     = {2018},
  abstract = {Data of sequential nature arise in many application domains in forms of, e.g. textual data, DNA sequences, and software execution traces. Different research disciplines have developed methods to learn sequence models from such datasets: (i) in the machine learning field methods such as (hidden) Markov models and recurrent neural networks have been developed and successfully applied to a wide-range of tasks, (ii) in process mining process discovery techniques aim to generate human-interpretable descriptive models, and (iii) in the grammar inference field the focus is on finding descriptive models in the form of formal grammars. Despite their different focuses, these fields share a common goal - learning a model that accurately describes the behavior in the underlying data. Those sequence models are generative, i.e, they can predict what elements are likely to occur after a given unfinished sequence. So far, these fields have developed mainly in isolation from each other and no comparison exists. This paper presents an interdisciplinary experimental evaluation that compares sequence modeling techniques on the task of next-element prediction on four real-life sequence datasets. The results indicate that machine learning techniques that generally have no aim at interpretability in terms of accuracy outperform techniques from the process mining and grammar inference fields that aim to yield interpretable models.},

(e.g., orders) are handled. However, reality may not agree with what is modeled. Conformance
checking techniques reveal and diagnose differences between the behavior
that is modeled and what is observed. Existing conformance checking approaches tend
to focus on the control-flow in a process, while abstracting from data dependencies,
resource assignments, and time constraints. Even in those situations when other perspectives
are considered, the control-flow is aligned first, i.e., priority is given to this
perspective. Data dependencies, resource assignments, and time constraints are only
considered as “second-class citizens”, which may lead to misleading conformance
diagnostics. For example, a data attribute may provide strong evidence that the wrong
activity was executed. Existing techniques will still diagnose the data-flow as deviating, whereas our approach will indeed point out that the control-flow is deviating. In
this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed that balances the deviations with respect to all
these perspectives based on a customizable cost function. Evaluations using both synthetic
and real data sets show that a multi-perspective approach is indeed feasible and
may help to circumvent misleading results as generated by classical single-perspective
or staged approaches.},

process models from event logs, using conventional high-level process modeling languages, such as Business
Process Model and Notation (BPMN), leveraging their representational bias.
Design/methodology/approach – The integrated discovery approach presented in this work is aimed
to mine: control, data and resource perspectives within one process diagram, and, if possible, construct
a hierarchy of subprocesses improving the model readability. The proposed approach is defined as a sequence
of steps, performed to discover a model, containing various perspectives and presenting a holistic view of
a process. This approach was implemented within an open-source process mining framework called ProM
and proved its applicability for the analysis of real-life event logs.
Findings – This paper shows that the proposed integrated approach can be applied to real-life event logs of
information systems from different domains. The multi-perspective process diagrams obtained within the
approach are of good quality and better than models discovered using a technique that does not consider
hierarchy. Moreover, due to the decomposition methods applied, the proposed approach can deal with large
event logs, which cannot be handled by methods that do not use decomposition.
Originality/value – The paper consolidates various process mining techniques, which were never
integrated before and presents a novel approach for the discovery of multi-perspective hierarchical BPMN
models. This approach bridges the gap between well-known process mining techniques and a wide range of
BPMN-complaint tools.},

a holistic approach to verify the end-to-end soundness of a Petri

we present an effective, implemented technique that verifies soundness

improve their processes to ensure quality of care for patients. To identify process improvement opportunities, a
thorough process analysis is required, which can be based on real-life process execution data captured by health

process-related insights from process execution data, providing valuable and previously unknown information to
instigate evidence-based process improvement in healthcare. However, despite the potential of process mining,
its uptake in healthcare organizations outside case studies in a research context is rather limited. This observation
was the starting point for an international brainstorm seminar. Based on the seminar’s outcomes and with
the ambition to stimulate a more widespread use of process mining in healthcare, this paper formulates recommendations to enhance the usability and understandability of process mining in healthcare. These recommendations
are mainly targeted towards process mining researchers and the community to consider when
developing a new research agenda for process mining in healthcare. Moreover, a limited number of recommendations
are directed towards healthcare organizations and health information systems vendors, when
shaping an environment to enable the continuous use of process mining.},

  abstract   = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest
in enriching the traditional control-flow perspective of processes
with additional dimensions, the data perspective being the most
prominent one. At the same time, variants of Petri nets with
data have been extensively studied, giving raise to a plethora of
formal models with different expressive power and computational
guarantees. In this work, we focus on DPNs, a data-aware
extension of P/T nets where the net is enriched with data variables
of different types, and transitions are guarded by formulae that
inspect and update such variables. Even though DPNs are less
expressive than Petri nets where data are carried by tokens, they
elegantly capture business processes operating over simple case
data and taking complex decisions based on these data. Notably,
various techniques have been implemented to discover DPNs from
event data. However, such techniques do not guarantee that the
discovered DPN is actually sound. In previous work, we have
then studied how to check soundness of DPNs with simple databased
guards that can only compare variables with constants. In
this paper, we generalize the study of soundness to DPNs to the
fundamental case where the evolution of the process depends
on the comparison between the values carried by different
variables through linear inequations. Our main contribution is
to show decidability of soundness for this sophisticated class
of DPNs. This is done by constructing an abstract state space
of the net relying on the manipulation of constraints, and by
showing that such an abstract state space can be faithfully and
effectively inspected for soundness. The construction lends itself
to be directly implemented by combining standard state-space
construction methods with constraint programming techniques.},

  abstract   = {The detection of data breaches has become a major challenge for most organizations. The
problem lies in the fact that organizations often lack proper mechanisms to control and
monitor users’ activities and their data usage. Although several auditing approaches have
been proposed to assess the compliance of actual executed behavior, existing approaches
focus on either checking data accesses against security policies (data perspective) or checking
user activities against the activities needed to conduct business processes (process
perspective). Analyzing user behavior from these perspectives independently may not be sufficient
to expose security incidents. In particular, security incidents may remain undetected
or diagnosed incorrectly. This paper proposes a novel auditing approach that reconciles the
data and process perspectives, thus enabling the identification of a large range of deviations.
In particular, we analyze and classify deviations with respect to the intended purpose
of data and the context in which data are used, and provide a novel algorithm to identify
non-conforming user behavior.The approach has been implemented in the open source framework
ProM and was evaluated through both controlled experiments and a case study using
real-life event data. The results show that the approach is able to accurately identify deviations
in both data usage and control-flow, while providing the purpose and context of
the identified deviations.},

  abstract   = {The analysis of business processes is a multifaceted problem that is comprised of analysing both
activities’ workflow, as well as the decisions that are made throughout that workflow. In process
mining, the automated discovery of process models from event data, a strong emphasis can be found
towards discovering this workflow, as well as how data influences that workflow, i.e., decision point
analysis. Nonetheless, the data that is pertaining to the activities in the workflow does not necessarily
correlate with the control flow. Decisions that influence variables that are used by activities can
also impact other variables used later in the workflow without interfering with the order in which
activities are executed. Discovering this has not been addressed in literature, as current decision mining
techniques still rely on control flow.
To address this, Process Mining Integrating Decisions (P-MInD) is proposed. It relies on uncovering
the influence of activities on their variables and connects them by making use of sequence dependencies
present in the data. Furthermore, it allows to find autocorrelations, as well to incorporate case
variables. This allows to establish a holistic image of the decision layer, captured with Decision Model
and Notation (DMN), that is consistent with the discovered control flow. Furthermore, decision model
conformance checking, i.e., the matching of event logs with holistic models, is proposed to offer a
way to verify whether the models are corresponding with the behaviour that is present in the current
system. P-MInD is implemented and used on real-life data to verify its effectiveness.},

insights into the process. Thus, not all infrequent behavior should be considered

process discovery method that uses the data attributes to distinguish infrequent

in conformance checking (and process mining at a more

contemporary discovery algorithms aims at the identification of control-flow constructs. The increase

and annotation, is limited and fails to detect fundamental changes in the control-flow that depend on
context data. In this work, we thus propose a novel approach for combining the control-flow and data
perspectives under a single roof by extending inductive process discovery. Our approach provides
criteria under which context data, handled through unsupervised learning, take priority over controlflow
in guiding process discovery. The resulting model is a process tree, in which some operators carry
data semantics instead of control-flow semantics. We show that the proposed approach produces
trees that are context consistent, deterministic, complete, and can be explainable without a major
quality reduction. We evaluate the approach using synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that
the resulting models are superior to state-of-the-art discovery methods in terms of measures based

conformance according to existing measures. This paper presents a conformance
checking approach which considers the response to and recovery from unexpected
deviations during process execution, by analyzing the data updates involved and their
impact on the expected behavior. We evaluated our approach by applying it to a reallife
case study, utilizing different baseline alignment techniques. The results show that
our approach succeed to capture adapted behavior in response to deviations and may
provide insights concerning the implications of deviations in the process.},

up each single deviation. This approach easily leads to misleading diagnostics;
furthermore, it does not take into account user’s needs, that are

from event logs. Event logs contain abundant information related to an
event such as the timestamp of the event, the actions that triggers the
event, etc. Much of existing process mining research has been focused
on discoveries of process models behind event logs. How to uncover the
timing constraints from event logs that are associated with the discovered
process models is not well-studied. In this paper, we present an approach
that extends existing process mining techniques to not only mine but
also integrate timing constraints with process models discovered and
constructed by existing process mining algorithms. The approach contains
three major steps, i.e., first, for a given process model constructed by
an existing process mining algorithm and represented as a workflow net,
extract a time dependent set for each transition in the workflow net model.
Second, based on the time dependent sets, develop an algorithm to extract
timing constraints from event logs for each transition in the model. Third,
extend the original workflow net into a time Petri net where the discovered
timing constraints are associated with their corresponding transitions. A
real-life road traffic fine management process scenario is used as a case
study to show how timing constraints in the fine management process
can be discovered from event logs with our approach.},

Choices between multiple activities are specified through rules defined over process data. Existing decision mining methods focus on discovering mutually-exclusive rules, which only allow one out of multiple activities to be performed. These methods assume that decision making is fully deterministic, and all factors influencing decisions are recorded. In case the underlying decision rules are overlapping due to non-determinism or incomplete information, the rules returned by existing methods do not fit the recorded data well. This paper proposes a new technique to discover overlapping decision rules, which fit the recorded data better at the expense of precision, using decision tree learning techniques. An evaluation of the method on two real-life data sets confirms this trade off. Moreover, it shows that the method returns rules with better fitness and precision in under certain conditions.},

the bundling and unbundling of cargo across several instances of a logistics process or dependencies

to severe consequences and penalties, e.g., dangerous effects due to undesired drug interactions. ISC
might stem from regulatory documents, extracted by domain experts. Another source for ISC are
process execution logs. Process execution logs store execution information for process instances, and
hence, inherently, the effects of ISC. Discovering ISC from process execution logs can support ISC
design and implementation (if the ISC was not known beforehand) and the validation of the ISC
during its life time. This work contributes a categorization of ISC as well as four discovery algorithms
for ISC candidates from process execution logs. The discovered ISC candidates are put into context
of the associated processes and can be further validated with domain experts. The algorithms are
prototypically implemented and evaluated based on artificial and real-world process execution logs.
The results facilitate ISC design as well as validation and hence contribute to a digitalized ISC and

To alleviate this limitation, this paper introduces the ‘DataExtend’ technique that allows evaluating and comparing decision-mining techniques with each other, using a sufficient number of event logs and process models to generate evaluation results that are statistically significant. This paper also reports on an initial evaluation using ‘DataExtend’ that involves two techniques to discover decisions, whose results illustrate that the approach can serve the purpose.},

For supporting separation of concerns during the design phase, it is crucial to understand which aspects of decision-making enclosed in a process model should be captured by a dedicated decision model. Whereas existing work focuses on the extraction of decision models from process control flow, the connection of process-related data and decision models is still unexplored. In this paper, we investigate how process-related data used for making decisions can be represented in process models and we distinguish a set of BPMN patterns capturing such information. Then, we provide a formal mapping of the identified BPMN patterns to corresponding DMN models and apply our approach to a real-world healthcare process.},

The event logs generated by PAIS might contain information about decision making processes and can support the understanding and improving of procedures in companies. Mining decisions and constraints from logs has already been investigated, but so far only for each instance in a separate manner. However, in many practical settings instances are connected to each other if they share, for example, the same resources. Therefore, we present an approach for discovering Instance-Spanning Constraints (ISC) from event logs. The main idea is to identify instance-spanning attributes in the logs and to separate the logs accordingly. Based on these projections, classification algorithms are applied in order to obtain ISC candidates. The feasibility and applicability of the approach is evaluated based on artificial as well as real-life logs. The discovered ISC candidates are then assessed by domain experts.},

We extracted an event log that includes events on activities in the emergency room, admission to hospital wards, and discharge.

We try to automatically discover a process model of the patient trajectories, we check conformance to medical guidelines for sepsis patients, and visualize the flow of patients on a de-jure process model. The lessons-learned from this analysis are: (1) process mining can be used to clarify the patient flow in a hospital; (2) process mining can be used to check the daily clinical practice against medical guidelines; (3) process discovery methods may return unsuitable models that are difficult to understand for stakeholders; and (4) process mining is an iterative process, e.g., data quality issues are often discovered and need to be addressed.},

  abstract   = {Declarative process modeling languages are especially suitable to model loosely-structured, unpredictable business processes. One of the most prominent of these languages is Declare. The Declare language can be used for all process mining branches and a plethora of techniques have been implemented to support process mining with Declare. However, using these techniques can become cumbersome in practical situations where different techniques need to be combined for analysis. In addition, the use of Declare constraints in practice is often hampered by the difficulty of modeling them: The formal expression of Declare is difficult to understand for users without a background in temporal logics, whereas its graphical notation has been shown to be unintuitive. In this paper, we present RuM, a novel application for rule mining that addresses the abovementioned issues by integrating multiple Declare-based process mining methods into a single unified application. The process mining techniques provided in RuM strongly rely on the use of Declare models expressed in natural language, which has the potential of mitigating the barriers of the language bias. The application has been evaluated by conducting a qualitative user evaluation with eight process analysts.},

It enables analysis of end-to-end processes to facilitate process re-engineering and process improvement. Process mining techniques rely on the availability of data in the form of event logs. In order to enable process mining in diverse environments, the recorded data need to be located and transformed to event logs. The journey from raw data to event logs suitable for process mining can be addressed by a variety of methods and techniques, which are the focus of this article. In particular, techniques proposed in the literature to support the creation of event logs from raw data are reviewed and classified. This includes techniques for identification and extraction of the required event data from diverse sources as well as their correlation and abstraction.},

  abstract   = {Open Source Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and Electronic Health Records (EHR) are widely used in healthcare institutions because it is mostly free and customizable. Generally, EMRs and EHRs are used in healthcare institutions because their adoption reduces costs and improves patient outcomes through increased efficiency. During the adoption of EMRs/EHRs, whether open-source or closed-source, the number one concern of healthcare institutions is their workflow. When adopting any open-source software, there is a lot to consider, 'Free does not mean you have to compromise on utility.' Process mining helps to discover and analyze the actual process executions of an information system (IS). In this paper, we use process mining to check the conformance of the workflow of Open-Source EMRs (workflow from event logs of an EMR) and the workflow of hospitals (workflow of hospitals based on domain knowledge). We modeled the workflow of hospital processes using business process modeling notation (BPMN) and converted it into a Petri net. Event log extracted from an Open-Source EMR (OpenEMR) was preprocessed for process conformance checking in ProM Framework. We check the conformance of log and model using alignment and replay. We display the results based on four metrics (fitness, precision, simplicity, and generalization). Then, we filter logs to check the conformance of Role-based access controls. Our conformance checking results showed that processes in Open-Source EMR align with the processes executed by hospitals.},

However, all these structures and formats share a common ground: the business-process model and its instantiation are in each of their kernels.

  abstract   = {Sequential pattern mining (SPM) is a well-studied theme in data mining, in which one aims to discover common sequences of item sets in a large corpus of temporal itemset data. Due to the sequential nature of data streams, supporting SPM in streaming environments is commonly studied in the area of data stream mining as well. On the other hand, stream-based process discovery (PD), originating from the field of process mining, focusses on learning process models on the basis of online event data. In particular, the main goal of the models discovered is to describe the underlying generating process in an end-to-end fashion. As both SPM and PD use data that are comparable in nature, that is, both involve time-stamped instances, one expects that techniques from the SPM domain are (partly) transferable to the PD domain. However, thus far, little work has been done in the intersection of the two fields. In this focus article, we therefore study the possible application of SPM techniques in the context of PD. We provide an overview of the two fields, covering their commonalities and differences, highlight the challenges of applying them, and, present an outlook and several avenues for future work.},

Involving goal-related factors, as often done in requirements engineering, can improve the rationality and interpretability of mined models and lead to better opportunities to satisfy stakeholders. This paper proposes a new Goal-oriented Process Enhancement and Discovery (GoPED) method to align discovered models with stakeholders’ goals. GoPED first adds goal-related attributes to traditional event characteristics (case identifier, activities, and timestamps), selects a subset of cases with respect to a goal-related criterion, and finally discovers a process model from that subset. We define three types of criteria that suggest desired satisfaction levels from a (i) case perspective, (ii) goal perspective, and (iii) organization perspective. For each criterion, an algorithm is proposed to enable selecting the best subset of cases were the criterion holds. The resulting process models are expected to reproduce the desired level of satisfaction. A synthetic event log is used to illustrate the proposed algorithms and to discuss their results.},

Research on process flexibility, however, has traditionally been focused on the intrinsic capability of a process to adapt to a new environment (e.g. workflow escalation, ad hoc modelling). This paper proposes to extend the existing body of research by studying the extrinsic drivers for process flexibility, that is, the root causes that actually drive the demand for flexible business processes. The drivers for flexibility can be found in the context of a process and may include among others time, location, weather, legislation or performance requirements. We argue for a stronger and more explicit consideration of these contextual factors in the design of business processes in order to make processes more adaptive. This paper discusses why context matters and how context can be conceptualised, classified and integrated with existing approaches to business process modelling. We use a goal-oriented process modelling approach to be able to identify relevant context elements and propose a framework and a meta model for classifying relevant context. These extensions are an essential foundation for the definition and implementation of truly agile processes, and as such of high practical and theoretical value.},

  abstract   = {Business process modelling languages typically enable the representation of business process models by employing (graphical) symbols. These symbols can vary depending upon the verbosity of the language, the modelling paradigm, the focus of the language and so on. To make explicit different constructs and rules employed by a specific language, as well as bridge the gap across different languages, meta-models have been proposed in the literature. These meta-models are a crucial source of knowledge on what state-of-the-art literature considers relevant to describe business processes. The goal of this work is to provide the first extensive systematic literature review (SLR) of business process meta-models. This SLR aims to answer research questions concerning: (1) the kind of meta-models proposed in the literature, (2) the recurring constructs they contain, (3) their purposes and (4) their evaluations. The SRL was performed manually considering papers automatically retrieved from reference paper repositories as well as proceedings of the main conferences in the Business Process Management research area. Sixty-five papers were selected and evaluated against four research questions. The results indicate the existence of a reasonable body of work conducted in this specific area, but not a full maturity. In particular, in answering the research questions several challenges have (re-)emerged for the Business Process Community, concerning: (1) the type of elements that constitute a Business Process and their meaning, (2) the absence of a (or several) reference meta-model(s) for the community, (3) the purpose for which meta-models are introduced in the literature and (4) a framework for the evaluation of the meta-models themselves. Moreover, the classification framework devised to answer the four research questions can provide a reference structure for future descriptive categorizations.},

  abstract   = {The concept of context awareness has been in existence since the 1990s. Though initially applied exclusively in computer science, over time it has increasingly been adopted by many different application domains such as business, health and military. Contexts change continuously because of objective reasons, such as economic situation, political matter and social issues. The adoption of big data analytics by businesses is facilitating such change at an even faster rate in much complicated ways. The potential benefits of embedding contextual information into an application are already evidenced by the improved outcomes of the existing context-aware methods in those applications. Since big data is growing very rapidly, context awareness in big data analytics has become more important and timely because of its proven efficiency in big data understanding and preparation, contributing to extracting the more and accurate value of big data. Many surveys have been published on context-based methods such as context modelling and reasoning, workflow adaptations, computational intelligence techniques and mobile ubiquitous systems. However, to our knowledge, no survey of context-aware methods on big data analytics for business applications supported by enterprise level software has been published to date. To bridge this research gap, in this paper first, we present a definition of context, its modelling and evaluation techniques, and highlight the importance of contextual information for big data analytics. Second, the works in three key business application areas that are context-aware and/or exploit big data analytics have been thoroughly reviewed. Finally, the paper concludes by highlighting a number of contemporary research challenges, including issues concerning modelling, managing and applying business contexts to big data analytics.},

Thus, defining and using contextual information may help to improve the predictive monitoring of business processes, which is one of the main challenges in process mining. However, identifying this contextual information is not an easy task because it might change depending on the target of the prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology named CAP3 (Context-aware Process Performance indicator Prediction) which involves two phases. The first phase guides process analysts on identifying the context for the predictive monitoring of process performance indicators (PPIs), which are quantifiable metrics focused on measuring the progress of strategic objectives aimed to improve the process. The second phase involves a context-aware predictive monitoring technique that incorporates the relevant context information as input for the prediction. Our methodology leverages context-oriented domain knowledge and experts' feedback to discover the contextual information useful to improve the quality of PPI prediction with a decrease of error rates in most cases, by adding this information as features to the datasets used as input of the predictive monitoring process. We experimentally evaluated our approach using two-real-life organizations. Process experts from both organizations applied CAP3 methodology and identified the contextual information to be used for prediction. The model learned using this information achieved lower error rates in most cases than the model learned without contextual information confirming the benefits of CAP3.},

To this end, we propose a three-stage methodology to deal with the several challenges of this goal. Adhering to the process mining paradigm that suggests for evidence-based process analysis and improvement, we introduce a horizontal partitioning approach to identify elements of process behavior during the first stage. Then, during the second stage, we discuss how log manipulations can yield characteristics that reflect various perspectives of the process. Finally, we propose a multi-target feature evaluation step to deliver insights about the associations between characteristics and process behavior. The proposed methodology is designed to tackle challenges related to the general correlation problem of process mining, like dealing with general process behavior (not just local decisions) and relaxing the independence assumption among the elements of behavior. We demonstrate our approach step by step through a case study on a real-world, open dataset.},

One essential problem related to this development is that the BPM body of knowledge does not account for a broader variety of business contexts. On the contrary, most approaches, methods, or models in BPM suggest one way forward, and we recognize that BPM projects following a one-size-fits-all approach are prone to fail, since they do not sufficiently consider situational requirements. In this viewpoint article, we argue that BPM needs to be contextual in order for projects to be most efficient and effective. We observe a lack of research on how to identify and characterize business contexts relevant for tailoring the right BPM approach. Therefore, we examine contextual factors that influence BPM and propose a framework to identify the context in which BPM is applied. We define context in BPM as situational factors related to goal-, process-, organization-, and environment-dimensions. Our viewpoint article not only creates awareness for contextual BPM, it also intends to stimulate research on the role of context in BPM and to help practitioners better understand the specific business context in which BPM initiatives are applied.},

The activity of compliance checking is commonly referred to as auditing. As information systems supporting the organization's business record their usage, process mining techniques such as conformance checking offer the auditor novel tools to automate the auditing activity. However, these techniques tend to look at process instances (i.e., cases) in isolation, whereas many compliance rules can only be evaluated when considering interactions between cases and contextual information. For example, a rule like "a paper should not be reviewed by a reviewer that has been a co-author" cannot be checked without considering the corresponding context (i.e., other papers, other issues, other journals, etc.). To check such compliance rules, we link event logs to the context. Events modify a pre-existing context and constraints can be checked on the resulting context. The approach has been implemented in ProM. The resulting context is represented as an ontology, and the semantic web rule language is used to formalize constraints.},

  abstract   = {We describe a method for formally representing the behaviour of complex processes by process windows. Each window covers a part of the system behaviour, i.e. a part of the underlying transition system, and is easier to understand and analyse than the complete transition system. Process windows can overlap and have shared states and transitions so that the complete system behaviour is the union of window behaviours. We demonstrate the advantage of such representations when dealing with complex system behaviours, and discuss potential applications in circuit design and process mining. As a motivational example we consider the problem of covering transition systems by marked graphs, or more generally choice free Petri nets. The obtained windows correspond to choice-free behavioural scenarios of the system, wherein one window can take over, or wake up, after another window has become inactive. The corresponding wake-up conditions and wake-up markings can be derived automatically.},

Similarly, event data can be used to verify conformance to prescribed behavior and to analyze and improve the underlying processes. However, not all events that are related to a process necessarily relate to its control-flow. Some events occur in the context of the process. In this work, we introduce the concept of context events to deal with these types of events. We show how distinguishing between contextual and control-flow events AIDS process discovery to obtain less complex process models. We demonstrate how visualizing context events on top of process models helps identify points in the process where context events occur often, aiding understanding. We analyze these benefits using two case studies involving real-life processes and event data.},

MIMIC supports a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule improvement, and electronic tool development. It is notable for three factors: it is freely available to researchers worldwide; it encompasses a diverse and very large population of ICU patients; and it contains highly granular data, including vital signs, laboratory results, and medications.},
